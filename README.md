This Java program provides a simple command-line menu for performing two mathematical operations: calculating factorial and generating a Fibonacci sequence.
It imports necessary classes for input/output operations (BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, and IOException).
The Part1 class contains the main method, which serves as the entry point for the program.
Inside the main method:
It creates a BufferedReader object to read input from the console.
Displays a menu with three options:
Calculate Factorial
Generate Fibonacci Series
Exit
Reads the user's choice from the console input.
Uses a switch statement to perform the corresponding operation based on the user's choice:
Case 1: Calculates the factorial of a given positive integer.
Case 2: Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
Case 3: Exits the program.
Default: Displays an error message for invalid choices.
